# Provisioning Overview 

The identity provisioning framework is the main component that handles user/ role provisioning in WSO2 Identity Server (WSO2 IS). WSO2 IS supports both inbound provisioning and outbound provisioning with several external applications. 

For more details on how to configure different types of inbound and outbound provisioning for WSO2 IS, see the [Inbound Provisioning](../../identity-provisioning/inbound-provisioning) and [Outbound Provisioning](../../identity-provisioning/outbound-provisioning).
