## Editing or deleting a role using SOAP

A role can be edited or deleted by calling the service
`         RemoteUserStoreManager        ` . If you are new to admin
services, see [Calling Admin
Services.](insert-calling-admin-services)

1.  Disable the hidden admin service property in the
    `           <IS_HOME>/repository/conf/deployment.toml          ` file.  
    By default, the admin services are disabled as it is not recommended
    to expose these URLs to users. However, this can be enabled by the
    administrators if it needs to be accessed.

    ``` toml
    [admin_service.wsdl]
    enable = false
    ```

2.  Open the following Admin Service from [SOAP UI](https://www.soapui.org/downloads/latest-release.html):
    [https://localhost:9443/services/RemoteUserStoreManagerService?wsdl  
    ](https://localhost:9443/services/RemoteUserStoreManagerService?wsdl)

    !!! info 
        If you have configured WSO2 IS to use an IP or hostname, replace
        `            localhost           ` with your IP or hostname.

3.  Call theÂ method **updateRoleName `            ()           `** to
    rename a role and **deleteRole()** to delete a role.
